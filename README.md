Mobile Flashcards
====
## Intro
This is a React Native application that lets you you create decks of flashcards to test yourself
on subjects that you're studying. Once you finish quizzing yourself on a set of flashcards, your 
score will be displayed and you'll be given an option to retake the quiz or  go back to the overview of the deck.
The app will display a daily notification at 8:00p.m. if you haven't practiced
a set of flashcards for the day.

## Installation 
1. First make sure you have [yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) locally.
2.
```

## Launch
This app has been tested on iOS using an iOS simulator, so we will 
work exclusively in this environment.
